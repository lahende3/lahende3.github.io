My main research topic is homomorphic encryption, which can be found on my [research page](https://kyleyates.github.io/research/). This page contains information on various other unpublished projects that I have worked on.

### Coding Theory Projects

**Ball-collision Decoding Analysis: Linear Codes in the McEliece Cryptosystem. (Undergraduate Thesis)**

This undergraduate thesis implemented, tested, and analyzed the [ball-collision decoding algorithm from Bernstein, Lange, and Peters](https://cr.yp.to/codes/ballcoll-20110307.pdf). The final version of my undergraduate thesis can be found [here](https://kyleyates.github.io/assets/pdf/BCDproject.pdf). The plaintext code for my implementation of the ball-collision decoding algorithm in Magma computational algebra (V2.24-6) can be found [here](https://kyleyates.github.io/assets/BCDalgorithm.txt).
